# Snake

Basic project with purpose to remind JavaScript and basic of HTML I won't lie, jumping from C# back to JS was a little frustrating experience - you can really appreciate how good is Microsoft's language :)

I had to come trough among others:

- querrySelectorAll -> I never like it to be honest but this time it really gave me a hard pill to swallow -_- 
I had an idea wich part of was sorting and pushing DOM elements into two dimensional array. Well, how I would not be writing code, it didn't wanted to cooperate...

In this case it's not end of the world but if there would be 100 more times squares, searching each time through all the id elements migh would cause some problems

- I needed to remind myself also classes in JS. I wanted to keep all the "move" commands on one sheelf, finally it's looks quite nice.

There was smaller problems such as lack of posibility do add "if" to case code, undefined problems and etc.

Program needs to be finished -> touch walls, simple settings and game over are going to be implemented soon;
